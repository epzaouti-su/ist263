My name is Elias Zaoutis, I am a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Finance and Accounting and minoring in Economics and Information Management & Technologies. I am interested in pursuing a career in the financial services industry where I will be able to use my quantitative and analytical skills that I have acquired over my college career. I also completed a summer investment banking analyst internship at a middle market bank in New York City where I was able to build upon my financial modeling and critical thinking skills. Outside of my professional accomplishments, I am from Long Island and have grown up with a family pizzeria business that my grandfather founded in 1974. Some of my other interests include playing soccer and weight lifting.
