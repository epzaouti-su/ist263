                Soccer is one of the biggest and widely followed sports in the world. With an estimated total fan base of 3.5 billion people, roughly 44% of the world population follows soccer in some capacity. I fall into the 44% of the population that follows soccer, as I have grown up playing the sport and have been on many different travel and school teams over the past few years. During my junior and senior year of high school, I was the captain of my varsity high school team, and was also the captain for my travel team that was ranked #4 in New York State. I was the goalie for all of the teams that I played for, and led the league in saves during my senior year season. Having grown up playing soccer turned me into a fan of the largest soccer league in the world, the English Premier League [EPL]. The EPL was founded on February 20th, 1992 and is made up of 20 teams that are known as some of the best soccer teams in the world. The league operates on a relegation and promotion platform. This means that the 3 teams with the least amount of league points at the end of the season get relegated to the lower league, and the three teams that have the most league points at the end of the season in the lower league get promoted and take their place in the EPL. With that said, over the 29 years that the league has existed, only 7 clubs have held the league title (most league points). Those clubs are: Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and Liverpool. The most recent teams that have won the title are Liverpool (2019-2020) and Manchester City (2018-2019). There is a lot of different elements that make up a ‘league winning team’. The actual players get the most attention but there are many other important pieces to a successful team. This includes: the head manager, team doctors, physical trainers, technical coaches and much more. The following pages go into greater detail about the last two EPL winners.
