                Manchester City won the EPL two seasons ago during the 2018-2019 season. This was the clubs 4th time winning the EPL, and most fans will say that this was their most impressive season. Their Spanish manager, Pep Guardiola, led a team that was riddled with injury to a total of 98 EPL points and record of 32 wins, 2 draws, and 4 losses. The ex-Barcelona legend had to strategically manage a squad of stars to the impressive league record. His style of play is one that combines fast ‘tiki-taka’ passing football with possession, calculated attacks, and intense defensive pressure. This style of play calls for constant movement and a large amount of squid stamina. The average midfielder ran a total of ~13km or ~8 miles over the 90 minute game. This taxing, but effective style of play is what allowed Manchester City to win the league.
